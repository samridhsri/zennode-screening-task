# zennode-screening-task

I wasn't sure how I was supposed to present this problem, so I created a basic HTML page with all of my solution logic in a JavaScript file. If I missed something, you can reach out to me via email at samridh@gmail.com. I'd be happy to make any necessary changes. I'm looking forward to hearing from you
